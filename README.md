# NexusS

## Project Overview
NexusS was built in under **34 hours** for the [BIG Hackathon](https://big.devpost.com/), hosted by the [Computer Science Club (CS Club), University of Adelaide](https://csclub.org.au/), and the [UniSA Programming Community (UPC), University of South Australia](https://usasa.sa.edu.au/clubs/join/upc/) under the theme **“merger.”**
The idea is simple: NexusS is a web app that helps students *merge* their independent study sessions by connecting them with others nearby.

With NexusS, students can:
- **Discover nearby study sessions** based on the courses they’re interested in and drop by to join.
- **Host a session** by marking their location, inviting others to join them.

This way, NexusS helps uni students find study buddies and make new friends.

## Technologies
### Frontend:
- Next.js: React framework for building web apps
- TypeScript: type safety
- Shadcn UI: component styling
- Tailwind CSS: utility-first styling
### Backend:
- MongoDB: database to store sessions and user data
- Supabase: store images on the cloud
- Vercel: deployment
### Other tools:
- MapLibre: maps and locations display
- Zod: input validation for the study session form

## Features
- Browse nearby study sessions based on course or interest
- Share your current study session location to invite others
- Works well on mobile devices too!

## Installation

```
npm install
npm run dev
```


Then start the application at http://localhost:3000

## Challenges
One team member had to leave early due to health issues but still managed to contribute remotely! :D

## Future Improvements
Improve performance to handle lots of users and sessions at once without slowing down.
